I installed an early version of the [comma.ai](https://comma.ai/) system on my car. Running [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) allows my 2017 Toyota Prius to have lane keeping function similar to Tesla Autopilot. Some simple modification of the code allows me to control my car with the 4 button keyboard I've built.
